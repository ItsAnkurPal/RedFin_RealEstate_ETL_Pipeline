### Overview:
This data pipeline project is designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) real estate data from Redfin’s website into a Snowflake data warehouse, with Apache Airflow managing the entire workflow on an AWS EC2 instance. The final data is used to generate reports in Power BI. The pipeline ensures data is processed efficiently, securely, and is readily available for analysis and reporting.

**Architecture Components:**

1. **AWS EC2 Instance:**
   - **Role:** Centralized compute resource where the entire ETL process is orchestrated.
   - **Specifications:** EC2 instance with appropriate compute and memory resources to handle the data volume and processing requirements.

2. **Apache Airflow:**
   - **Role:** Workflow management and orchestration tool.
   - **Functionality:** Schedules and monitors the ETL tasks, ensuring dependencies are managed, tasks are retried on failure, and logs are maintained for debugging and monitoring.
   - **Configuration:** Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) define the workflow, including tasks for extraction, transformation, and loading of data.

3. **Extract:**
   - **Source:** Redfin real estate data.
   - **Tool:** Python scripts executed within Airflow tasks.
   - **Process:** 
     - Python scripts scrape or use APIs to extract data from Redfin.
     - Extracted data is temporarily stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

4. **Transform:**
   - **Intermediate Storage:** Data is fetched from the S3 bucket for transformation.
   - **Tool:** Python Pandas.
   - **Process:**
     - Data cleaning and transformation are performed using Pandas.
     - Transformed data is validated and checked for quality.
     - Post-transformation, the data is stored back in another S3 bucket.

5. **Load:**
   - **Trigger:** Snowpipe (Snowflake’s data ingestion service).
   - **Process:**
     - Snowpipe automatically detects new data in the S3 bucket and loads it into Snowflake.
     - Data is then available in Snowflake’s data warehouse for querying and analysis.

6. **Reporting:**
   - **Tool:** Power BI.
   - **Process:**
     - Power BI connects to Snowflake to fetch the latest data.
     - Reports and dashboards are created and updated in Power BI based on the Snowflake data.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Extraction Phase:**
   - Airflow triggers Python scripts to extract data from Redfin.
   - Data is fetched and temporarily stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

2. **Transformation Phase:**
   - Airflow triggers another set of Python scripts that use Pandas to clean and transform the data.
   - Transformed data is validated and saved back to an S3 bucket.

3. **Loading Phase:**
   - Snowpipe is configured to monitor the S3 bucket for new data.
   - Once new data is detected, Snowpipe loads it into Snowflake.
   - Data becomes available in Snowflake for further analysis.

4. **Reporting Phase:**
   - Power BI connects to Snowflake to retrieve the processed data.
   - Reports and dashboards are generated and updated to reflect the latest data.

### Benefits and Features:

- **Automation:** The entire ETL process is automated using Airflow, reducing manual intervention and increasing efficiency.
- **Scalability:** EC2 instances can be scaled up or down based on processing needs, and S3 provides scalable storage.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Airflow provides robust monitoring and logging, ensuring any issues in the pipeline are promptly addressed.
- **Cost-Effective:** Using EC2 and S3 allows for cost-effective data processing and storage.
- **Security:** AWS services ensure data security through encryption and access control mechanisms.

The diagram visualizes the pipeline stages and interactions between different components:

- **Extract:** Data extraction from Redfin using Python on EC2, stored in S3.
- **Transform:** Data transformation using Pandas on EC2, managed by Airflow, intermediate storage in S3.
- **Load:** Data loading into Snowflake via Snowpipe, with final reporting in Power BI.

This comprehensive ETL pipeline ensures that real estate data is efficiently extracted, transformed, and made available for analysis and reporting, leveraging the power of AWS and Snowflake for a scalable and robust data solution.
